before being able to run the program or use the Autoscan class, install the necessary packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also use a package manager like pipenv to create a virtual environment with these packages:
```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
and then:
```
pipenv shell
```
or
```
pipenv run autoscan.py
```

To use the standalone program:
```
./autoscan.py
```
